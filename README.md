Task 1
Google Home Page recreation 

Few notes : 

1. Missing a couple of Functionalities, mainly because these features are tied to Javascript which we weren't allowed to use, some would require work beyond the scope of simply designing the page, which again is what we were asked to do. 

2. Not completely responsive, all building was done on a **1366/768 screen**, so the CSS might be messed up other screen sizes, sorry :( i know how to use media imports for site responsiveness, but we weren't exclusively asked to do that, so i didn't bother.
